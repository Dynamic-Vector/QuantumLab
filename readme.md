## Basic Concepts
**Superposition**-Superposition is the ability of a quantum system to be in multiple states at the same time until it is measured.<br>
**Qubit**-A qubit is a two-level quantum system where the two basic qubit states are usually written as ∣0⟩ and ∣1⟩.It is in a linear combination of both state by the phenomenon of **Superpositon**.Unlike the normal computer bit which is either 0 or 1.
